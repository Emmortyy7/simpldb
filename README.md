This my first failed code but it thought me a lot.

I tried to make a database but i did it so deorganized that even the most simple part of code became not understandable.

My next project will probably be a virus for ps vita and i will write that code very well organized because writing code that is deorganized makes it 10 times harder to understand and develeop.

(This code wont work btw so i didnt add any makefile or bash file to compile it.)
